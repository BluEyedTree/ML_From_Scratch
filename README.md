# ML_From_Scratch
> A bunch of machine learning models and algorithms written from scratch (or scrattish in some cases).

The goal is to have every algorithm written as clearly and concisely as possible. Hopefully, this will be a useful resource for novice machine learning enthusiasts! 

Each file is named after the algorithm that it contains. 

## Usage example

python KNN.py

Running any file should give some sensible output based on a toy dataset from sklearn.

## Development setup

requirements text coming soon!

```sh
pip install sklearn
```
